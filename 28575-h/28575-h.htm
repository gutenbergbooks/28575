<h2><a name="Foreword" id="Foreword"></a>Foreword</h2>


<p>In the belief that the establishment of a first-class
<i>Terminal Market</i> system, worthy of twentieth
century requirements, is a matter of vital importance
to every family in New York, I have spent
considerable time during the past few months investigating
markets on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>As a result I am more than ever conscious of the
need for an enlightened public opinion to support the
efforts of the Terminal Market Commission to secure
this benefit for our community. I am convinced that
our fellow-citizens will approve the requisite expenditure
once they are roused to a realization of the
inadequacy of our food-distributing centers.</p>

<p>In the hope that my investigations may aid in
the accomplishment of this reform, I have prepared
these observations, comments and comparisons.</p>

<p>It is true that the problem of the high cost of
living is afflicting the old lands of Europe, the newer
countries like New Zealand, as well as our own wide
territories of the United States. The causes vary, according
to local conditions; but everywhere it is agreed
that a potent force for the amelioration of the condition
of the consumers is found in the establishment of efficient
Terminal Markets under municipal control for all
progressive cities. With wise administration, stringent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
inspection and sound safeguards, these municipal markets
benefit both producers and consumers. They
eliminate considerable intermediate expense, delay and
confusion. Last but not least they return a profit to
the city treasury.</p>

<p>It is because our New York markets achieve none
of these beneficent results that I issue this plea for the
establishment of an adequate <i>Terminal Market</i> system.
I appeal to all who have the welfare of their city at
heart to add the force of their opinion to the accomplishment
of this civic improvement.</p>

<h2><a name="United_States" id="United_States"></a>United States</h2>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>New York</big></span>, with over 5,000,000 inhabitants, has no effective
market system. The buildings are out of repair, there is little
or no organization, and the superintendent has testified before
the New York Food Investigation Commission (March 12,
1912) that on their administration last year there was <i>a loss to
the city treasury of $80,000</i>. To that must be added due consideration
of the inconvenience to the consumers, producers and
dealers, and the extra cost of handling entailed by the lack of
modern market methods. The city has almost quadrupled its
population in a generation, but the markets remain about as
they were. Many other cities in the United States not only
testify to the value of municipal markets as a means for lowering
prices to the consumer, but so guard their interests as to
provide a very different balance sheet.</p>

<p>Boston has a profit on its markets of $60,000, Baltimore
$50,000, New Orleans $79,000, Buffalo $44,000, Cleveland
(Ohio) $27,507, Washington (D. C.) $7,000, Nashville (Tenn.)
$8,200, Indianapolis $17,220, Rochester (N. Y.) $4,721, and St.
Paul (Minn.) $4,085.</p>

<p>If the following facts concerning municipal markets are
studied, also, it will be seen that no city in any way comparable
to New York fails to make the municipal markets yield advantages
both to the community and the city treasury.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="The_British_Isles" id="The_British_Isles"></a>The British Isles</h2>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>London</big></span> naturally serves as a starting point for a tour of
European investigation. The British capital has, indeed, features
that render it comparable in a peculiar degree with New York.
The population of both, including their outer ring of suburbs,
is over five millions. In each case there is access to the open
sea by means of a noble waterway over which passes the commerce
of the seven seas. Railroads supplement the water-borne
cargoes with home-grown produce, fresh from the farms for the
use of urban kitchens.</p>

<p>London's markets do not afford the unbroken example of
municipal control that they would if a new system were to be
created at the present day. Precedent looms large in British
administration and even now there are only two ways of establishing
a market&mdash;by Parliamentary authority and Royal Charter.
King Henry III covenanted by charter with the City of
London not to grant permission to anyone else to set up a market
within a radius of seven miles of the Guildhall, and this
privilege was subsequently confirmed by a charter granted by
Edward III in 1326. But of late years the City Corporation
has waived its rights and allowed markets to be established in
various districts wherever a real necessity has been shown to
exist. In fact the markets of London have grown with the
city, keeping pace with its requirements.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>There remains, however, the fact that certain Corporation
markets and Covent Garden market serve as great wholesale
terminals, connected more or less unofficially with the numerous
local markets in the outlying districts.</p>

<p>Chief among the Corporation markets is Smithfield, covering
about eight acres, and costing altogether $1,940,000. There
are to be found wholesale meat, poultry and provision markets,
with sections for the sale, wholesale and retail, of vegetables
and fish. In the last twenty years the development of cold
storage processes has lowered the quantity of home-killed meat
and remarkably increased the importation of refrigerated supplies.
Last year the wholesale market disposed of 433,723 tons
of meat, of which 77.2 per cent came from overseas.</p>

<p>Ten years ago the United States supplied 41 per cent of
the Smithfield meat, but now these supplies have fallen off enormously
and the last report of the Markets Committee says:
"The United States, in particular for domestic needs, is within
measurable distance of becoming a competitor with England for
the output of South America." South America and Australasia
are, indeed, the chief producers today for the British market.</p>

<p>This has developed a great cold storage business in London.
All told London can accommodate 3,032,000 carcases of
mutton, reckoning each carcase at 36 pounds. Over 41 per
cent of England's imported meat passes through Smithfield, and
railroad access is arranged to the heart of the market. The
Great Northern Railway Company has a lease from the corporation
on 100,000 feet of basement works under the meat market,
with hydraulic lifts to the level of the market hall, and
inclined roadways for vehicular traffic.</p>

<p>Most of the tenants at Smithfield are commission salesmen,
who pay weekly rents for their shops and stalls at space rates, all
the fittings being supplied. Last year these rents brought in
$427,920. There is a toll of a farthing on every 21 pounds of
meat sold, which together with cold storage, weighing and other
charges amounted in the same period to $241,635. The meat sales
are entirely wholesale, except on Saturday afternoons, when
there is a retail "People's Market," where thousands of the very
poor buy cheap joints.</p>

</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>The inspection is very strict, every precaution is taken to
ensure cleanliness, and breaches of the regulations are punished
by fines or imprisonment. All condemned carcases are sent to a
patent Podewill destructor to be reduced by steam pressure and
rolling to a powder, which is disposed of as an agricultural
fertilizer.</p>

<p>On these central meat markets there is a <i>profit of about
$100,000</i>.</p>

<p>The Corporation also controls a great live cattle market at
Islington, covering seventy-five acres. Over $2,500,000 have
been spent on this market and the modern slaughterhouses attached
thereto. These slaughterhouses are not regarded as a
remunerative concern, but are provided because they afford hygienic
methods, and private slaughterhouses in London are decreasing
rapidly. Last year 37,670 cattle, 101,646 sheep, 11,722
calves and 34,981 swine were slaughtered there, the charges
being 36 cents a head for cattle, 4 cents for sheep, 8 cents for
calves, and 12 cents for hogs. Mainly on account of the extensions
and improvements, this market is not being run at a
profit at present, but its public utility is held to justify the
outlay. Nor does the Deptford Cattle market, of thirty acres,
maintained on the banks of the Thames to deal with live cattle
imported from abroad, pay its way. But there has been a serious
decline in imported stock in late years, especially from America.
At this market extreme precautions are taken to prevent the
entry of cattle disease that might spread infection to British
flocks and herds. All animals landed there must be slaughtered
within ten days and submitted to rigid inspection. All hides and
offal are immediately disinfected. Five hundred cattle can be
unloaded from vessels at Deptford in twenty minutes. Last year
104,351 animals were killed, the meat being sent for sale to
Smithfield and Whitechapel.</p>

<p>Billingsgate, the famous fish market of London, is also administered
by the Corporation. Its records cover over six hundred
years. It is hampered by narrow street approaches, but a
very expeditious system of direct delivery of fish from the
Thames side of the market building enables the licensed auctioneers
to dispose of supplies very quickly. Steam carriers collect
the fish from the fleets around the coast and deliver them
packed in ice at Billingsgate every night. Billingsgate market
has cost the city $1,600,000. Stand prices are high, but there
is keen competition whenever a vacancy occurs. Last year the
receipts amounted to $182,455. The auctioneers dealt with 194,477
tons of fish, of which 120,905 were water-borne and 73,572
land-borne. <i>The City profited to the extent of over $40,000</i> on
this fish trade.</p>

<p>On the wholesale and retail meat, fruit, vegetable and fish
market at Leadenhall there is also a profit of over $5,000.</p>

<p><i>On the entire municipal market enterprises of the city there
is a profit of $156,000.</i> The markets are regarded with especial
interest by the Corporation and the Committee which regulates
them is considered one of the most important in the whole
administration of the city. In order to keep abreast of the times
most of the profit is expended on improvements and extensions.</p>

<p>Covent Garden, London's great fruit, flower and vegetable
market, is owned by the Duke of Bedford, whose family have
held it for hundreds of years. In the past century they have
spent $730,000 on extensions and improvements. Of the present
modern buildings, the fruit hall cost $170,000 and the flower
building $243,000. Formerly the producers were chiefly concerned
in the market, holding their stands at a yearly rental.
But with the expansion of London the growers have gradually
given place to dealers and commission men, who pay twenty-five
cents a day per square foot of space, and on the produce, at a
regular scale, according to its nature. On flowers there is no
toll, but each stand holder pays a fixed rental. Though this market
has direct access neither to river nor railroad, it still retains
its premier position among the wholesale markets of England.
As the approaches are extremely narrow, most of the produce has
to be carried on the heads of hundreds of porters from the wagons
outside into the market buildings. As it is under private ownership,
no figures are issued, but there is known to be a huge profit
on the market. For outer London there are fruit and vegetable
markets at Stratford, in the east, Kew in the west, the Borough
in the south and two railroad markets in the north.</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>Birmingham</big></span>, England's chief midland city, has owned
its markets since 1824, administering them through a markets
and fairs committee. Since 1908 the profits have been somewhat
reduced, owing to outlay on improvements and extensions;
but although the city has expended $2,156,362 on the markets,
the profits have paid off more than half of that indebtedness, besides
relieving taxation in other directions.</p>

<p>Not far away is the small city of KIDDERMINSTER, that
may be mentioned as affording a demonstration of provincial
municipal enterprise, under more restricted conditions. On its
vegetable market it makes a <i>profit of $1,000</i>, and on its butter
market <i>a profit of $1,500</i>. The population of the city is only
25,000. Another midland city, WOLVERHAMPTON, makes
a <i>profit of nearly $20,000</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><big>Liverpool</big></span>, the great northern port on the Mersey, has
spent $1,242,534 on six municipal markets. The only market to
lose money is the cattle market, which shows a deficit of $8,000.
Liverpool has a cold storage capacity for 2,176,000 carcases.
On the whole municipal market enterprise, in this city of 700,000
people, there is an average annual <i>profit of $80,000</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>Manchester</big></span> serves not only its own area but surrounding
industrial centers, with a total population of nearly 8,000,000.
There are twelve markets and four slaughterhouses. Since 1868
the city has benefited by their administration to the extent of
<i>$3,250,000 profit</i>.</p>

<p>Next to that of London, the fish market here is the largest
in England. Its annual profit is well over $10,000, in addition
to heavy extension payments in late years.</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>Dublin</big></span>, the capital of what is often called 'the distressful
isle,' makes <i>a profit of $14,000</i> on the food market and <i>$12,000
more</i> on the cattle market, while EDINBURGH, Scotland's chief
city, makes about <i>$15,000 a year on municipal markets</i>.</p>

<p>Statistics are available of something like 150 other British
towns and cities, ranging from a population of 5,000 upwards,
where there is the conviction born of experience that municipal
markets pay not merely in profits, but in convenience to the community,
and they have a powerful influence in keeping prices
down.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Germany" id="Germany"></a>Germany</h2>


<p>Perhaps more than any other country in the world Germany
places reliance on municipal markets, because of the peculiar
pressure of the problem of the high cost of living in the cities
of the Fatherland. On several occasions, during the last twelve
months, the butchers' stalls have been raided by women in protest
against the ten per cent increase in one year on the price
of meat. And when, to meet the clamor, the government reduced
the hitherto prohibitive import duties on meat by one-half and
the inland railroad charges by one-third, it was on condition that
the meat brought in should be for delivery to municipal markets
or co-operative societies only. The result has been an immediate
fall in retail prices ranging up to fifty per cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap"><big>Berlin's</big></span> two million people since 1886 have had a splendid
terminal market on the Alexanderplatz, consisting of two great
adjoining halls, with direct access to the city railroad. One of
these halls is entirely wholesale, while the other is partly wholesale
and partly retail. Meat, fish, fruit and vegetables are dealt
with under the same roof by upwards of 2,000 producers and
dealers.</p>

<p>The whole market cost $7,250,000, of which $1,920,711 was
for the main market and $4,852,862 was for the slaughterhouses,
which are most elaborately equipped to ensure sanitation and
cleanliness. Great as the market is, the pressure of business has
grown so much that a project is on foot to construct more accommodation
at a cost of $15,000,000. The market is maintained
by stand rentals and administrative charges and by a fund
established for the improvement and extension of the system. On
the entire enterprise, when all charges have been met and interest
paid, there is <i>a profit of over $135,000 a year</i>.</p>

<p>A committee of eleven, partly city councillors and partly
selected representatives of the public, administer the markets
with ninety-three officials to ensure the carrying out of their
orders. The regulations are most elaborate, especially as regards
the inspection of foods, which is conducted by a department having
a staff of six hundred.</p>

<p>A healthy competition is created by the system of sales,
which may be conducted by the producer himself, or through
an approved wholesale dealer, or through one of the six municipal
sales commissioners. These municipal sales commissioners have to
give bonds on appointment and are not allowed to have any
interest in the trade of the market beyond a small percentage on
sales. Producers living at a distance can have their business
carried through by them under conditions so well understood
and respected as to ensure confidence. Though the municipal
sales commissioners handle less than a quarter of the sales, they
nevertheless act as a check on the private dealers, especially as
they issue a regular report on the average wholesale prices.
Moreover the purchasers benefit by these market arrangements,
for if they buy from a regularly authorized dealer they can file
a claim with the administration if the supplies delivered are faulty
and if their case is proved the account will be rectified.</p>

<p>About fifty railroad car loads can be handled at once at the
market, but when extended accommodation is provided it is intended
to deal with two hundred carloads simultaneously. On
supplies thus delivered a railroad tax is collected from the receivers
for maintaining rail connections, and this yields an annual
profit of $11,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<p>Of the stand holders, nine-tenths are monthly tenants, and
the remainder pay by the day. The highest charge is 9.5 cents
per square meter a day for meat stalls. The fish sold comes
mainly from Geestemunde, at the mouth of the Weser, and is
sold under the strictest conditions, only a small commission being
allowed to be added by the dealers.</p>

<p>The slaughterhouses deal with 800 wagons daily and for the
use of the butchers and the market generally 2,000 square meters
of distilled water are produced every day, valued at four cents
the square meter. Eight thousand pipes conduct the water to
every part of the market. To ensure cleanliness, bathrooms and
rooms for drying clothes are established for the use of the
butchers, who are charged two and a half cents a bath. In
inspecting the carcases the veterinaries take the most minute
precautions. From every animal four samples are taken, at
different parts of the body, and each of these samples is submitted
to tests for twenty minutes.</p>

<p>In an average year 14,000 carcases are condemned and destroyed,
as well as 400,000 diseased parts. Whenever possible
the inspectors cut away diseased portions, and the remainder
of the carcase, after being sterilized, is sent to the markets known
as the Freibank, for sale to the very poor. This proportion is
not so startling when it is considered that something like two
million animals are slaughtered every year, of which more than
half are pigs. Until recently Germany used to export a large
number of prime animals to the London market, but the demands
of home consumers now prevent this and the export trade has
practically ceased. In fact Germany, in common with the rest
of Europe, is now competing for the world's refrigerated supplies.</p>

<p>Storm doors and windbreaks are provided at the entrances
to the markets and wagons are only allowed inside at certain
hours and through specified doorways. Thus there is an absence
of dust, and a carefully arranged series of windows ensure ample
ventilation. All dealers have to unpack their stock at least once
every seven days, for the destruction of unsound articles. All
supplies of unripe fruit, horseflesh and artificial butter have to
carry labels disclosing their real nature. Attached to the market
is a hospital with skilled attendance, for cases of sickness or
injury happening on the market premises.</p>

<p>As in most other centers, the establishment of the market
led to the peddlers entering into outside competition. They
bought their supplies wholesale inside, and then offered them
cheaply outside, free from stand rentals and other charges. This
menace to the prosperity of the market grew so great that the
peddlers' traffic in adjacent streets was prohibited and strictly
limited elsewhere. This measure, in fact, is deemed essential in
every city where municipal markets are conducted successfully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><big>Cologne</big></span> completed a million dollar market in 1904, with
a cold storage plant and connections with the state and narrow
gauge railways. Nearly half the space is taken up by wholesale
dealers in fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>The chief fault of the market is the remoteness from the
center of the town. At first it had a great success but, on this
account, it has not been entirely maintained. Encouraged by that
initial prosperity, the city authorities bought a nearer site, but
the subsequent decrease in the market's popularity has caused
the postponement of extensions. Though the market does not
pay the five per cent on capital that is required, the present
administration, even with its drawbacks, does succeed in making
a profit of about three per cent on the capital invested, last year's
income amounting to $535,200.</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>Hamburg</big></span> is peculiarly situated as to its market conditions.
The market halls of Hamburg and Altona adjoin, but while the
former is under the control of the Hamburg senate, the latter
is subject to the laws of the Prussian government and administered
by the Altona city authorities. Each has a large hall,
with a considerable portion of the space used for auctions. The
senate of Hamburg appoints two auctioneers and Altona one;
but, while the latter is a salaried official, the former are two
Hamburg auctioneers approved by the government for the special
market business, on undertaking not to trade on their own account.
The trade of the chief market is in fish. With the Altona
market, the Hamburg market and the Geestemunde market,
the sales in this section of Germany are the most important in
the Fatherland for fresh sea fish, and salted herrings. About a
fourth comes in fishing cutters or steam trawlers direct alongside
the market halls, while the remaining three-fourths come
from Denmark by rail or by ships from England, Scotland and
Norway. Often there are three or four special fish trains from
the north in a day, while twenty-five to thirty steamers bring the
regular supply of imported fish.</p>

<p>The auctioneers derive their revenue from a four per cent
charge on sales of the cargoes of German fishing vessels and
five per cent on imported supplies. Out of this they pay half
of one per cent to the government on the German and one per
cent on the foreign sales. No fees are charged to importers and
dealers using the auction section of the fish market. Out of the
percentage paid to the government by the auctioneers is provided
light and water, the cleansing of the halls and the carting away
of refuse for destruction. Strict regulations govern the inspection
of the fish and to ensure the destruction of those that have
deteriorated they are sprinkled with petroleum immediately on
detection.</p>

<p>Steam fishing boats using the market quays pay 48 cents
for 24 hours' use, seagoing sailing cutters 24 cents, river sailing
cutters 6 cents, and small boats 3 cents, in which charges the
use of electric and other hoists is included.</p>

<p>From these markets almost the whole of Germany receives
its sea fish supplies, for the distribution of which most of the
leading dealers have branch houses in the principal cities.</p>

<p>There are also two markets&mdash;one in Hamburg and one in
Altona&mdash;for the sale of farm produce, mostly transported thither
by boats. Besides these, there is a big auction for imported fruit,
conducted by private firms. All these Hamburg markets are
prosperous, and their utility to the community is universally acknowledged.</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>Frankfort's</big></span> market system dates back to 1879, when the
first hall was erected at a cost of $375,000. It has 548 stands
on the main floor renting at $1.08 per two square meters a month,
payable in advance, while there is space for 347 more in the
galleries at 84 cents per two square meters a month. Nearby
is a second hall, built in 1883 at a cost of $143,750. A third
hall followed in 1899 at a cost of $38,500, while in 1911 further
extensions were determined on and there are fresh projects now
under consideration. Besides these covered markets the city has
a paved and fenced square that has been used since 1907 as an
open market, where stands are rented at 5 cents a day.</p>

<p>Sixty per cent of the stands in the market halls are rented
by the month and forty per cent by the day. Tuesdays and Fridays
are reserved for wholesale trading. A market commission
rules the markets and the police enforce their regulations, the
violation of which is liable to cost the offender $7.20 in fines or
imprisonment up to eight days.</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>Munich</big></span>, with a population of half a million, has the most
modern of all the European municipal markets. It was opened
in February, 1912, and embodies the improvements suggested by
experience of market administration in other cities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>The total cost was $797,000, of which $510,000 was spent
on four communicating iron market halls, with their cellar accommodation
underneath, $190,000 on a receiving and toll department,
$52,000 on a group of adjacent buildings, including a
post-office, restaurant and beer-garden, and $45,000 on roadways.
The whole establishment covers 46,500 square meters, of
which the market halls occupy 37,100 square meters.</p>

<p>At the northern extremity of the buildings is the toll and
receiving department, where produce is delivered at special sidings
connected with the south railway station of the city. Next
comes a succession of lofty halls, with covered connections, terminating
in a small retail section and the administration offices. At
the northern end of the great market is a section where express
delivery traffic is dealt with, while the western side is occupied
with sidings for loading produce sold to buyers from other German
centers.</p>

<p>Below the toll house and the market generally are vast cold
storage cellars and refrigerating plants for the preservation of
surplus supplies till the demand in the market above calls for
their delivery. Each market hall is devoted to a separate section
of produce, and the cellars below are correspondingly distinct,
so that there is an absence of confusion, orderliness is ensured,
and rapid deliveries facilitated. Across this underground space
from north to south run three roadways, while down the center,
from east to west, a further broad aisle is provided, with an
equipment of great hydraulic lifts. There are nine of these lifts
altogether for heavy consignments, while each stand-owner in
the market has, in addition, a small lift connecting his stand
and storage cellar.</p>

<p>Both market halls and underground cellars are so constructed
as to facilitate ventilation and complete cleanliness. The
floors are of concrete and every stand is fitted with running
water, with which all the fittings have to be scoured every day.
There is both roof and side light, and ample ventilation, while
the entrances are wind-screened, to prevent dust. Electric light
is used underground, and the cellars are inspected as strictly as
the upper halls, to ensure due attention to hygiene. In the center
of each market hall there are offices and writing rooms for
those using the markets. In the restaurant 150 can be served
with meals at one time, or they can be accommodated with seats
in the beer-garden.</p>

<p>Associated with this market establishment is a great cattle
market and range of slaughterhouses on a neighboring site. The
live cattle market dates back for centuries, but the present accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
was only completed in May, 1904, at a total cost
of $1,600,000.</p>

<p>Last year 809,508 animals were sold, including 432,159 swine
and 234,457 calves. In the slaughterhouses 713,228 of these were
killed, besides 2,619 horses and 97 dogs. About twenty-five per
cent of the animals reach the market by road from neighboring
farms, while seventy-five per cent come by rail. For the inspection
of all flesh foods there are very strict rules, enforced
by the chief veterinary surgeon, Dr. Müller, and a staff of specially
trained assistants. As in Berlin, extensive bathrooms are
provided for the slaughterhouse staff, and baths are available at
nominal charges. Though the new market halls have not been
established long enough to provide a definite financial statement,
the live-cattle market and slaughterhouses do afford an indication
of the success of municipal administration in Munich. Last
year the income was $416,500 and the expenditure $410,100, thus
showing a profit of $6,400. The new produce halls are certainly
the best equipped in the world, and the only element of doubt as
to their success arises from the fact that three old-fashioned open
markets are nearer the center of the city and for that reason are
even now preferred by many retailers. This fact emphasises the
importance of selecting a central position in establishing a municipal
terminal market.</p>

<h2><a name="France" id="France"></a>France</h2>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>Paris</big></span> has one of the most skilfully organized municipal market
systems in Europe. The chief food distribution center for
the 3,000,000 Parisians is established at the Halles Centrales, a
series of ten pavilions covering twenty-two acres of ground and
intervening streets. Altogether this great terminal market has
cost the city more than $10,000,000.</p>

<p>Most of the pavilions are entirely for the wholesale trade,
but some are used as retail markets to a limited extent. Retail
traders are being decreased gradually, so that whereas in 1904
there were 1,164 retail stands there are now only 856.</p>

<p>The total receipts of the Halles Centrales and thirty local
markets amount to $2,100,000, of which <i>about $1,000,000 is
profit</i>. There is a general advance in the wholesale trade, but the
local covered markets or marchés de quartier, are not progressing
in the same way, so the city does not quite maintain a steady
level of market profit.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>The reasons given for the falling off of the retail trade are
various, but the principal causes appear to be (1) the growth
of big stores, with local branches, that deliver the goods at the
door, thus relieving the purchaser of the necessity of taking home
market supplies; (2) the number of perambulating produce
salesmen, who sell from carts in the street at low rates, having
neither store rent nor market tolls to pay, and (3) the growth of
co-operative societies.</p>

<p>A complicated and severe code of regulations governs the
markets. Commission salesmen at the Halles Centrales must be
French citizens of unblemished record and must give a bond of
not less than $1,000 in proof of solvency. Producers may have
their supplies sold either at auction or by private treaty, as they
prefer, and as none of the agents are allowed to do business
for themselves the distant growers have confidence in the market
methods.</p>

<p>In the retail markets each dealer in fresh meat pays just
under $6.00 a week in all, while dealers in salted meats, fish,
game and vegetables pay a much lower rate. All, however, in
the covered markets pay three taxes&mdash;one for the right to occupy
a stand, one for the cleaning and arranging of the markets, and
one for the maintenance of guardians and officials. In the open
markets the stands are rented by the day, week, or year, the rate
for the day ranging from ten to thirty cents, according to space.
Several of these local markets have charters dating back to pre-revolution
days, that cannot now be annulled.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to devise a more thorough system of
inspection. An average year's seizures include half a million
pounds of meat, 17,000 pounds of fruit and vegetables and half
a million pounds of salt water fish.</p>

<p>Thus the Paris market arrangements provide an admirable
central clearing house, where supplies are inspected and sold
under such conditions as to prevent the artificial raising of prices.
It also acts as a feeder to the marchés de quartier, to the great
convenience of local consumers. Moreover the producer is safeguarded,
for on his supplies a small fixed percentage only can be
charged by the salesman, and the current market prices are made
public by agents especially detailed for that purpose.</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>Havre</big></span>, the well-known French seaport, with a population of
130,000, has a profit of over six per cent on the Halles Centrales
and ten per cent on the fish market. All told there is <i>a profit of
$27,000</i> on the twelve municipal markets.</p>

<p>The Halles Centrales occupy an entire square in the center
of the city and cost $75,000, exclusive of the site. Gardeners
and farmers are not permitted to sell their produce on the way
to the market and are only allowed to deliver to storekeepers
after the wholesale markets are closed. Here, as elsewhere where
the markets are successful, every precaution is taken to avoid the
prosperity of the market being dissipated by sales in the surrounding
neighborhood. The annual rents for butchers are very
moderate, ranging from $57.90 to $154.40, vegetable dealers
$42.85 to $92.64; dairy produce dealers $52.11 to $85.11, fishmongers
$23.16 to $86.85. In the wholesale markets there is an
annual trade turnover worth well above $1,000,000, of which
fish represents $280,000. So far from the fishermen finding the
fish market detrimental to their interests, they welcome it and
cheerfully observe the rule forbidding sales on the quays or
transit sheds except under special permits.</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>Lyons</big></span>, with a population of half a million, may be taken as
the best example of a flourishing French provincial city at a
considerable distance from the sea. The principal market, La
Halle, is known all over France for its public auctions. Accommodation
is provided for 276 stalls, rented at 14 cents a day per
square meter for fruit, vegetables and cheese, while other stalls
for meat and fish are rented at 33 cents per square meter.</p>

<p>At the morning auctions, held at the rear of the hall, are
sold immense quantities of fish, oysters, lobsters, game, poultry,
butter, cheese, eggs, fruit and vegetables. There is a rule that
all supplies must come from outside Lyons, so that local store
men cannot there dispose of surplus stocks, but dealers in other
French cities often thus relieve themselves when overloaded.
These auctions not only enable local dealers to distribute supplies
at cheap rates to the small stores all over the city, but wide awake
housewives can frequently tell just what the stores gave wholesale
for the produce offered to them retail later in the day, so a
check can be kept on overcharges.</p>

<p>The auctioneers are given a monopoly of selling for ten
years, on binding themselves to pay to the city a sum equal to
two per cent on the total annual sales. The minimum is fixed at
$1,930 for one stand or $5,650 for four stands, to be paid to the
municipal treasury. Two per cent is added to the purchase price
of every payment made by buyers at auction, and if this does not
amount to $1,930 per stand for the year, the auctioneer has to
make up the difference. The poorer classes benefit largely by
these sales, banding together to buy wholesale and then dividing
their purchases.</p>

<p>There are also seventeen markets for general retail trade
in Lyons. The Terminal Market of La Halle cost the city $886,980.
The company which built it was given a concession for
fifty years, on a division of profits arrangement, but within
sixteen months the utility of the market as an advantageous
enterprise for the city was so clearly demonstrated that the municipality
bought the company out.</p>

<p>Market commissioners appointed by the municipality conduct
the business of the markets according to strict regulations,
enforcing a rigid inspection of all products as well as weights
and measures. Violations of these rules are punishable by fines

diseased persons being rigidly excluded. Though a wide variety
of articles are sold in the smaller markets besides farm produce,
storekeepers are not allowed to rent stalls, so the market
men and farmers alone have the use of the buildings. The regulations
under which they trade were drawn up by a market
commission and confirmed by ministerial decrees. These regulations
are regarded in Europe as a model of comprehensiveness
and their observance ensures close attention to hygiene. Among
the rules is one insisting on the placing of all waste paper in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
public refuse receptacles, while another compels the use of new,
clean paper only in wrapping up food products.</p>

<p>Stalls are rented from four to ten cents a day, according to
the accommodation. Supplies come by boat, rail and wagon, and
when there is pressure on the interior market space sales are
allowed from the boats and wagons at a toll of ten cents a day.
Otherwise only merchandise is allowed to be sold outside the
market halls. Not only must no fish, game, meat or poultry be
sold without first being passed by the veterinary inspectors, but
none of these articles of diet must be brought to market packed
in straw, cloth or paper. Unripe fruit must not be sold to
children.</p>

<p>Every day a bulletin issued by the market commission sets
out the wholesale prices, while a weekly list gives the retail
prices, but in the latter case the note is added that the market
commission will not be responsible for any controversy that may
arise. All the stocks held by the market traders are insured
by the municipality, though not to their full value.</p>

<p>Not only have these markets proved beneficial to the consumers
generally, but the market men are unanimous as to their
advantage, for they afford a ready and inexpensive means
of doing a large business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><big>Amsterdam</big></span>, with a population of 510,000, has all the local
markets under the control of the municipality. They are divided
into five districts, each managed by a director or market master,
responsible to the city council.</p>

<p>Two of the markets are covered, but the remainder are open
and are situated by the side of the canals, along which the produce
is brought in boats from the farms around. On the administration
of the markets in an average year there is <i>a profit of
$36,000</i>, but there is a law against making a profit on municipal
enterprises, so the surplus is spent on local improvements.</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>Rotterdam</big></span>, another great Dutch seaport, operates its
markets under similar conditions and makes <i>a profit of $34,000</i>,
of which $23,000 comes from the cattle and meat markets.</p>

<p>The renting of space to standholders at the central market

below $11.58 per month for meat, $9.65 for poultry and game,
$5.79 for fruit, vegetables, butter and cheese.</p>

<p>Both producers and dealers sell at these markets, all their
supplies being subjected to drastic inspection regulations. All
meats are tested by the municipal veterinary surgeon and his
staff, while a communal chemist regulates the milk, butter and
general dairy produce. The cleansing of the markets is done by
the department of public cleanliness. Some of the public markets
are managed by a contractor, who receives $250.90 a year for
setting up the stalls and keeping them in good order. He deposits
a security on undertaking his contract and in default of
a satisfactory performance of his work the commune does it and
charges him with it.</p>

<p>It has been testified that New York's annual food supply costs,
at the railroad and steamer terminals, $350,000,000. But the
consumers pay $500,000,000 for it. The balance of $150,000,000
does not necessarily indicate that any particular section of middle-men
have been exacting excessive profits. It merely demonstrates
that too many people handle the produce between the farm and
the fireside. The provision of an adequate Terminal Market
system for New York would apply the remedy.</p>

<p>New York stands alone, for a city of its importance, in
having to face an annual deficit on its markets. The results elsewhere
prove that the deficit could be turned into a profit by the
creation of a Terminal Market system, equipped and administered
on twentieth century lines.</p>

<p>America is exporting less foodstuffs than formerly. The
annual value has fallen $126,000,000 in eleven years. The
growth of the manufacturing population and the relative decrease
of the agricultural population, together with the gradual impoverishment
of much of our farm land, will soon make conditions
worse unless we organize our food distribution.</p>

<p>The first step for New York is the establishment of a Terminal
Market system. It is estimated that New York's population
will continue to grow at the rate of fully 100,000 a year, so
this problem admits of no further procrastination.</p>

<p>In natural resources America is the richest country in the
world. Other nations have to import vast quantities of produce
because of the restricted area of their territory, the comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
unfruitfulness of their soil, or their adverse climatic conditions.
We have a wide land of boundless fertility, never wholly in the
grip of winter's cold. Yet we no more escape the high cost of
living than these less favored peoples overseas. They have partially
compensated for their disadvantages by organizing their
markets, while we have neglected that important branch of civic
enterprise.</p>

<p>Everywhere in Europe, the provision of adequate terminal
markets under municipal control is pointed to as a powerful
aid in keeping food prices down. There is a lesson in that for
New York and other American cities.</p>

<p>There is a lesson also for growers in up-state districts, for
experience shows that with adequate markets, supplying produce
at lower rates, there comes a demand for more farm and garden
stuff and a greater variety of it. This directly aids in developing
rural prosperity and enhances the value of agricultural land.</p>

<p>I believe a marked improvement will be shown if a bureau
is maintained to inform farmers as to the demands of the market
and the best method of packing, preparing and despatching
their produce so as to reach the market in prime condition. Not
only will that aid the market, but it will have a powerful influence
in arresting "the drift from the land" to the cities.</p>

<p>The municipality should select central positions for its markets,
with rail and river access. It should have effective control
not only over the markets but the adjacent streets, wharves, and
railroad sidings, so as to obviate evasion of the market tolls. The
rentals should not be high, and no sub-letting should be allowed
under any circumstances.</p>

<p>Under such conditions, with wise administration, New
York's Terminal Market system could be made a model that
would be studied by other cities in an age when economic questions
absorb the attention of all our public-spirited men and
women.</p>

<p>In the interests of the people's health and happiness, no less
than in consideration of the municipal finances, all should rally
to the support of those who are seeking to secure the consummation
of this urgent reform at the earliest possible moment consistent
with a full consideration of all its aspects.</p>
